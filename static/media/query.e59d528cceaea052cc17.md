The Archive Viewer application provides patient, visit or order level views of historical data
(prior to June 4th, 2022) from legacy systems that have since been archived into the
Digital Health Platform. Use the form below to find archived records.

For now, **you can only retrieve data by MRN** (1230001 and 1230002 currently exist in
the demo database). **Any other combination of patient identity fields will produce no results**.
